# Introduction
Following my [first publication](https://medium.com/@rodrigo.motoyama/batting-average-should-we-cancel-it-ade0b2c48379), I wanna talk about one of my favorite batting statistics, OBP or On Base Percentage. Hopefully after reading this you will get hooked up on OBP as I am :). I intend to cover what OBP means and measures, why it is a good statistic, where it fails, and why I think it is better than others basic ones, like avg (batting average) and slg (slugging percentage). So bear with me and let's dive in to it.

## On Base Percentage
If you like baseball and have watched Moneyball once in your life, you can probably skip this topic. If you don't know baseball and have watched Moneyball because you saw Brad Pitt on the cover, this topic could be useful for you. Or if you are just here because I wrote something and you are supporting me, I love you. Now let's talk OBP.
As every percentage, we are talking about a ratio or as I like to call this, the ratio of how many times a batter has done something of value. This statistic is the percentage of how many times a batter got on base on merritt. 
The idea is simple, this is gonna tell you how many times the batter got on base safely or not. Meaning that if a batter has an OBP of 0.400 (or just .400), it means that 40% of the time the plate appearence was succesful, in other words, he did not generate an out.

## Player value
If you have read my first article, you may be thinking, "wait, doesn't batting average measure when the batter does something of value?", and you are partially correct. I say partially because batting average hides somethings from you. The average not only gives the same weight to all of the hits (singles, doubles, triples and home runs), but it also makes two "mistakes". First, it does not count walks and hit by pitches, which are scenarios where the batter gets on base safely and on merritt, and second, average is number of hits divided by at bats, not plate apparences, meaning that sacrifice flies (SF) are not taken into account. 
Ok, but how much those "mistakes" can change the statistics? Well, thanks to rotowire we can check it out.
```{r echo = FALSE, include=T}
table <-  mlb_df_300_ab %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% mutate(median_avg = median(avg),
                            median_obp = median(obp),
                            bb_pct_above_98 = quantile(bb_pct, 0.98)) %>% 
  filter(avg<=0.250, obp>=0.350) %>%  
  arrange(desc(obp)) %>% head(5)
table %>% select(year, player, avg, median_avg) %>% arrange(desc(avg)) %>% knitr::kable()
```
Cheking their batting averages alone, their seasons seem like a waste of money. All of them have avg under the median, meaning that at least 50% of the mlb players had a higher batting average than them. However, they did something amazingly good.

```{r echo = FALSE, include=T}
table %>% select(year, player, avg, obp, hr, bb_pct, "bb pct above 98" = bb_pct_above_98) %>% knitr::kable()
```
